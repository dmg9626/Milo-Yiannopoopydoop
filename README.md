# Milo-Yiannopoopyloop
an alt-right sandbox simulation experience

## What is this game?
This is a silly game I made at [Stupid Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com "Stupid Hackathon"). I wanted to work on my skills in Unity scripting with physics while making something simple that everyone can enjoy.

It's a juvenile experience best enjoyed firsthand.
