# Milo-Yiannopoopyloop
an alt-right sandbox simulation experience

## What is this game?
This is the result of showing up to [a hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com "Stupid Hackathon") very late. I wanted to work on my skills in Unity scripting with physics while making something simple that everyone can enjoy.

It's a juvenile experience best enjoyed firsthand.
