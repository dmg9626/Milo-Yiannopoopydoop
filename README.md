# Milo-Yiannopoopyloop
an immersive user-generated alt-right sandbox simulation experience

## What is this game?
This is the result of showing up to [a hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com "Stupid Hackathon") very late. I wanted to work on my skills in Unity scripting with physics while making something simple that everyone can enjoy. 

The game is as simple as it can get: press SPACE to poop. It's a juvenile experience best enjoyed firsthand.


## Installation

Open the folder containing your operating system and run the application within.
